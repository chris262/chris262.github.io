				"The Space Marines are a highly mobile army. Because of this, the points cost of a detachment usually includes enough Rhino transport vehicles to transport it and any upgrades that have been taken. Determine the number of Rhinos needed after all upgrades have been purchased. The number of Rhinos will always be the minimum needed to carry the formation, you can’t take extras along to cover any losses!",
				"Note that many formations don’t receive Rhinos, usually because they can’t fit into them. Detachments that come with Rhinos will be noted as having plus transport in the units section of the army list opposite.",
				"Also note that you don’t have to take Rhinos if you don’t want to. If you’d rather field the formation on foot instead, so it can act as a garrison for example, or be transported in a Thunderhawk Gunship, then you may do so.",
				"In addition, you may choose to replace a detachment’s Rhinos with Drop Pods. If you do this then the detachment will enter play in a Drop Pod using the rules for Planetfall (see Planetfall). Note that if you choose to do this you will also require at least one Space Marine Strike Cruiser or Battle Barge to deploy the drop pods from.",
				"Before each game, after the opposing army is known but before objectives are placed, the Space Marine player may choose which formations with the plus transport aspect are deployed in Rhinos, Drop Pods or on foot. If the formation has any units unable to deploy in Drop Pods then that option cannot be selected."
