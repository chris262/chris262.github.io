  o  test map a bunch of armies/formations to see what weird conditions break things
	DONE:	SM-CA		SM-BT		EL-BT		IG-dkok
	NEXT:	IK-knights 		what's done: formation and untis in place
			TY-dagon		what's done: partial formations and units


	THEN:	SM-iron hands,   CH-chaos marines,	OR-feral

  o  need a better way of objectifying the content. it's not terriby but would probably be easier if things were more objecty.
     doesn't need to be as much as armyBuilder where everything is run off objects.  jquery solves a lot of shit AB was trying to accomplish.
	 things like constrains might be easier.
  o (pertaining last)  it might be helpful to be able to look up items 'easier', so making a function to find a formation in the selections/reference. and/or finding a unit or unit types within the selections.


  o stats view [wip]
  o stats file [wip]


  o stats ->  table layout (sizes etc)
              'more' version to include specialRule descriptions  (slow, reinforces, invul save etc)
              'transport' details for transporting units   (2 regular, 1 terminator etc)

  o  rename 'transport' to 'something not transport'    it's now multi-purpose (i.e. dkok 'tank suqadron' upgrade on infantry)   'subselection' or something


  o on grid screen considering adding button  to remove 'main' selection option. additionally add buttons to up/down the position of the item (shuffle index).
     i do not want to drag drop things at all.
